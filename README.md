## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards

> [!WARNING]
> **Colors, card-number suffixes, and Backup access the live Wallet database.**
> They can temporarily make cards disappear or corrupt the database. Continue
> only if you accept the risk. Artwork-only changes do not access this database.
>
> Backup ZIPs contain only artwork and `wallet-style.json`, never database files
> or `pass.json`.
>
> **If cards disappear:** stop retrying, restart the iPhone, open Wallet, wait
> briefly, swipe Wallet away, then open it again. This worked repeatedly in
> real-device tests, but recovery is not guaranteed.

1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB cable and ensure it is unlocked and trusted.
2. In AirCard, stay on the **Wallet Cards** tab and click **Scan Cards**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - **Double-click the Side (Power) button** to open Apple Pay.
   - Authenticate with **Face ID**.
   - **Tap your card** (or tap it once more) to trigger instant detection!
4. Optionally click **Backup** on a detected card and choose where to save its current artwork and Wallet database style.
5. Click on any card mockup or drag & drop an image directly onto the card.
6. Use the **Digits** and **CARD label** color pickers when you only want to change Wallet text colors. These settings are available with or without a custom image.
7. Enter exactly four ASCII digits for the card-number suffix, or enter `NULL` to hide the card number. Blank input is not treated as `NULL`.
8. Click **Flash Skins** and review the database warning when colors or the card-number suffix are selected.
9. For database changes, fully restart the iPhone; reopening Wallet is not enough. For artwork-only changes, force-close and reopen Wallet.

## How to Apply Lockscreen Passcode Themes (.passthm)
1. Switch to the **Passcode Themes** tab at the top of AirCard.
2. Drag & drop any `.passthm` file into the app (or click **Choose .passthm File**).
3. AirCard will inspect the theme and display an interactive preview on the numeric keypad (0–9, *, #).
4. Click **Apply Passcode Theme**.
5. Restart your iPhone to reload the lock screen cache and see your custom passcode buttons!

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Language & Bold Text Support:**  
> AirCard automatically expands and flashes custom keypad assets for all system locales (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, German, French, etc.) and generates both standard and **Bold Text** cache bitmaps (`--white` and `--white-bold`), ensuring your theme works regardless of your iOS language or accessibility display settings!
